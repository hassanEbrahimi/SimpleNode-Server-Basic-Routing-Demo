# SimpleNode-Server-Basic-Routing-Demo
The "SimpleNode Server: Basic Routing Demo" project showcases a straightforward implementation of a Node.js server with basic routing functionality. This project serves as an introductory example for beginners to understand how to create a minimalistic web server using Node.js.

The server handles two primary routes:

# Home Route (/)
Displays a simple welcome message on the homepage.

# About Route (/about)
Provides information about the server, introducing it as a basic Node.js server.

In addition, the project includes error handling for handling requests to undefined routes, returning a 404 Not Found response.

This demonstration serves as a foundation for building more complex web applications and APIs using Node.js and helps learners grasp fundamental concepts such as routing, HTTP request handling, and server setup.
